FlashPunk 1.7.2 port to [Haxe 3](http://haxe.org/) + [OpenFL 1.1](http://www.openfl.org/). (alpha)

Experimenting with Haxe + OpenFL, mainly to learn the language and see if there's some performance gain 
in compiling for the Flash target. 

(... and taking a look at [HaxePunk](haxepunk.com) when I'm not sure about things)




Alpha version. It's almost a 1 to 1 port of FlashPunk 1.7.2 (very minimal changes) to Haxe 3 + OpenFL 1.1. 

All classes should work as expected, but minor issues will surely pop up (expecially for native targets). 
Compiler errors will most likely help you out!

Please file an issue [here](https://github.com/azrafe7/hxpunk/issues) if something doesn't work (targeting Flash!).
